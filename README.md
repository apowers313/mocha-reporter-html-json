Combines Mocha's [HTML Reporter](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/2bb2b9fa35818db7a02e5068364b0c417436b1af/lib/reporters/html.js) and [JSON Reporter](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/2bb2b9fa35818db7a02e5068364b0c417436b1af/lib/reporters/json.js) into a single reporter. This allows users to have a nice UI with progress and still be able to access the final results in a JSON format.
